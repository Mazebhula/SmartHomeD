Project Idea: Smart Home Energy Monitor
Description: Create a Java-based application that simulates or interfaces with a smart home energy monitoring system. The program collects, analyzes, and visualizes energy usage data for household appliances, providing insights to optimize consumption and reduce costs. You can simulate sensor data or, if you have hardware like Raspberry Pi, integrate real sensors.

Why It’s Unique:

Combines Java programming with IoT and data analysis, showing versatility.
Addresses real-world issues like energy efficiency and sustainability.

Scalable for GitHub: you can add features over time to demonstrate growth.
Visually appealing outputs (charts, dashboards) make it demo-friendly.
Key Features to Implement

Data Collection:

Simulate energy usage data (e.g., watts consumed by appliances like fridge, AC, lights) or read from a CSV file.
Optionally, interface with real sensors (e.g., using a Raspberry Pi with Java libraries like Pi4J).

Real-Time Monitoring:

Calculate real-time energy consumption and costs based on user-defined electricity rates.
Display usage per appliance or total household usage.

Data Analysis:

Compute daily, weekly, or monthly energy trends.
Identify high-consumption appliances and suggest optimizations (e.g., "Turn off AC at night").

Visualization:

Use Java libraries like JFreeChart or JavaFX to create graphs (e.g., line charts for usage over time).
Build a simple GUI to display stats and recommendations.

Alerts and Notifications:

Send alerts (e.g., via console or email simulation) when usage exceeds a threshold.
Recommend actions like switching to energy-saving modes.

Data Storage:

Store historical data in a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite with JDBC).
Allow users to export reports as CSV or PDF.

Tech Stack

Language: Java (use Java 17 or later for modern features).

GUI: JavaFX or Swing for a desktop interface.

Data Visualization: JFreeChart or JavaFX Charts.

Database: SQLite with JDBC for storing energy data.

Optional IoT: Pi4J for Raspberry Pi integration (if using real sensors).

Testing: JUnit for unit tests to show good coding practices.

Build Tool: Maven or Gradle for dependency management.

Sample Workflow

Input: Simulate sensor data (e.g., Appliance: Fridge, Power: 150W, Time: 2h) or read from a file.

Processing:

Calculate energy (kWh) and cost (Power × Time × Rate).
Store data in SQLite.
Analyze trends (e.g., fridge uses 30% of total energy).
Output:
Display a JavaFX dashboard with charts showing usage by appliance.
Show alerts like “Fridge consumption spiked by 20% today.”
Export a monthly report as CSV.
